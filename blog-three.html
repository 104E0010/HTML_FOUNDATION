        <p>
            A web library is a collection of reusable code that provides specific functionalities but doesn't dictate how your app should be structured. You can pick and choose what you need.

        <h3><li>Characteristics</li></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Focuses on specific tasks (e.g., animations, AJAX requests, UI components).</li>
                <li>More flexible; you can integrate them into any project.</li>
                <li>Doesn't enforce a specific architecture.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3><li>Examples</li></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>jQuery</strong> – Simplifies JavaScript DOM manipulation and AJAX.In 2012, jQuery was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. 
                    <br />While still in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
                <li><strong>Lodash</strong> – Utility functions for working with arrays, objects, and strings.</li>
                <li><strong>Chart.js</strong> – Helps create interactive charts and graphs.</li>
            </ol>

        <strong><li><h2>Web Frameworks</h1></li></strong>
    
        <p>
            A web framework is a more structured and opinionated tool that provides a foundation for building entire applications. It enforces a specific way of organizing code.

    <section>
        <h3><li>Characteristics</li></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides a predefined structure (e.g., MVC pattern, component-based).</li>
                <li>Manages routing, state, and backend integration.</li>
                <li>Often includes built-in libraries for common tasks.</li>
            </ul>
    </section>

        <h3><li>Examples</h3>
            <ol>
                <strong><li>Front-end Frameworks (for UI development)</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS)</strong> – Component-based framework for building interactive UIs. 
                            <br />It is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
                            <p> It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>
                            <p> It can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. 
                            <br />Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.</p> 
                            <p> A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Vue.js</strong> – Lightweight and flexible UI framework.</li>
                            <br /> 
                        <li><strong>Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")</strong> – is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. 
                            <br /> Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.</li>
                            <br /> 
                    </ul>
                <strong><li>Back-end Frameworks (for server-side logic)</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Express.js (Node.js)</strong> – Minimalist framework for building REST APIs.</li>
                        <br /> 
                        <li><strong>Django (Python)</strong> – Full-stack framework with built-in admin and authentication.</li>
                        <br /> 
                        <li><strong>Laravel (PHP)</strong> – Web framework with an elegant syntax for backend development.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br /> 
                <li>Vanilla JS</li> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The framework-like moniker "Vanilla JS" is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
                        </li>
